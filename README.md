# boids-and-game-of-life-simulation-
A collection of two interactive simulations demonstrating emergent behaviour:  Boids Simulation - Models flocking behaviour of autonomous agents using alignment, cohesion, and separation rules.  Game of Life - Implements Conwayâ€™s cellular automaton to showcase patterns evolving from simple rules.
